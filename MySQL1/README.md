# MySQL Level 1

I wrote a sript to generate a completely new database and table in MySQL.  The result of the script inside the MySQL console, including ```SELECT * FROM;``` is pictured.

Additionally, this directory also includes a saved version of the table which can be reloaded into MySQL.  It was generated by the following command (my password omitted):
```
mysqldump -u root -p[password] ex_db ex_tab > ex_tab.txt
```
