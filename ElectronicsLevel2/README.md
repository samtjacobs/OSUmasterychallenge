# Electronics Level 2

The prompt for electronics level 2 has two options.  One of which is proof that I have passed ECE323 and ECE322.  In this folder, I have supplied unofficial transcripts of those courses.  I believe that is satisfactory evidence.  If you would like more, such as SPICE schematics for my lab work, please contact me.  I am very busy, but I thank you for your patience.
